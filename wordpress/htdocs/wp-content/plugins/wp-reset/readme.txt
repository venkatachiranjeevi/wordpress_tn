**Please read carefully before proceeding to understand what WP Reset does**

#### Resetting will delete:

* all posts, pages, custom post types, comments, media entries, users
* all default WP database tables
* all custom database tables that have the same prefix table prefix as the one defined in _wp-config.php_ and used by default tables

#### Resetting will not delete or modify:

* media files - they remain in the _wp-uploads_ folder untouched but will no longer be listed under Media in admin
* no files are touched; plugins, themes, uploads - everything stays
* site title, WordPress address, site address, site language and search engine visibility settings
* currently logged in user will be restored with the current username and password

#### What happens when I click the Reset button?

* you will have to confirm the action one more time because there is NO UNDO
* everything will be reset; see bullets above for details
* site title, WordPress address, site address, site language, search engine visibility settings as well as the current user will be restored
* you will be logged out, automatically logged in and taken to the admin dashboard
* WP Reset plugin will be reactivated if that option is chosen in the post-reset options

#### WP-CLI support

WP Reset comes with full WP-CLI support. Help on our WP-CLI commands is available via _wp help reset_. By default the commands have to be confirmed but you can use the `--yes` option to skip confirmation. Instead of the active user, the first user with admin privileges found in the database will be restored after reset. Please be careful when using WP Reset with WP-CLI - as with using the GUI there is no undo.

#### Database Snapshots

Database snapshot is a copy of all WP database tables, standard and custom ones, saved in the currently used database (as set by _wp-config.php_). Files are not saved or included in snapshots in any way.
Snapshots are primarily a development tool. Although they can be used for backups (and downloaded as gzipped SQL dumps), we suggest finding a more suitable tool for doing backups of live sites. Use snapshots to find out what changes a plugin made to your database - what custom tables were created, modified, deleted or what changes were made to site's settings. Or use it to quickly restore the development environment after testing database related changes.
Restoring a snapshot does not affect other snapshots, or WP Reset settings. Snapshots can be compared to current database tables, restored (by overwriting current tables), exported ad gzipped SQL dumps, or deleted. Creating a snapshot on an average WordPress installation takes 1-2 seconds.


#### Multisite (WP-MU) Support

WP Reset has yet to be completely tested with multisite! Please be careful when using it with multisite enabled. We don't recommend to resetting the main site. Sub-sites should be OK. We're working on making WP Reset fully compatible with WP-MU. Till then please be careful. Thank you for understanding.

#### Partial Reset Tools

Delete transients - deletes all transient related database entries. Including expired and non-expired transients, and orphaned timeout entries.

Delete uploads - delete all files and folder in the /uploads/ folder.

Delete plugins - deletes all plugins except WP Reset which remains active.

Delete themes - deletes all themes.
